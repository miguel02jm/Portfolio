    "title": "WHO AM I? WHAT DO I DO?",
    "paragraph1": "My name is Miguel √Ångel Ja√©n. I was born in Ja√©n, a city in the south of Spain in 2002, where I still live today. In 2020, I started my career in the field of computer science and programming by beginning my degree in Computer Engineering in my city. I am currently continuing these studies, now in the 4th year, specifically in the branch of Information Technologies with a focus on Intelligent Information Processing.",
    "paragraph2": "In addition to my ongoing studies, I strive to learn new technologies on my own (Currently focusing on React for the Frontend, NodeJS for backend, and Flutter for mobile development). That's why I balance my studies with self-directed learning, putting this knowledge into practice by working on my own personal projects. You can take a look at them later on.",
    "paragraph3": "In conclusion, I define myself as a passionate software developer, with a strong team spirit. Despite not having professional experience yet, I seek to learn new concepts every day and implement them into the products I develop independently. This way, I create attractive and functional digital solutions, always aiming to deliver unique experiences."
